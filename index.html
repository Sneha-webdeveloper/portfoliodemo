                    <h4>About Me</h4>
                    <p>Steve Jobs, a visionary entrepreneur and tech pioneer, was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955. Alongside his partners Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, Jobs co-founded Apple Inc. in 1976, setting the stage for a transformative era in the world of personal computing. Their journey began modestly, operating out of Jobs' parents' garage, but their innovations soon reverberated globally. Jobs' first departure from Apple in 1985 was a result of internal conflicts, but his return to the company as CEO in 1997 marked a turning point. Under his guidance, Apple experienced a remarkable resurgence, introducing groundbreaking products that left an indelible mark on society, including the Macintosh, a computer with a revolutionary graphical user interface, and later, the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, all of which reshaped how we interact with technology. Jobs' leadership prowess not only solidified Apple's status as a technology giant but also extended to his ventures beyond the company. He founded NeXT Computer, with a vision of creating high-end workstations, and acquired Pixar Animation Studios, a move that led to a string of beloved animated films. Tragically, Jobs' life was cut short when he succumbed to pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor on October 5, 2011. Nevertheless, his profound legacy of innovation and creativity endures, continuing to influence and shape the tech industry. Walter Isaacson's biography, titled "Steve Jobs," provides an in-depth exploration of his life, complex personality, and the enduring impact he left on the world.</p>
